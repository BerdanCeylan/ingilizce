Ron! Ron, come on! Get out of bed! Why? There's something you've got to see! Now, come on! Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents! I only see us. Look in properly. Go on, stand there. There! You see them, don't you? [Harry] That's my dad. [Ron] That's me! Only I'm... Head Boy. And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup. And, bloody hell! I'm Quidditch captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future? How can it? Both my parents are dead. Harry, Harry, Harry. Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail? Not really. Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that. Bee in your bonnet, Potter? I— I was— I was just wondering if you put me in the right house? Yes, you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said last year, you would have done well in Slytherin. You're wrong. The task is two days from now. Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out? Wouldn't know. We don't actually talk about the tournament. Actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean, he's not particularly loquacious. Mm-hmm. Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon, I discovered a bowl on my desk. With just a few inches of clear water in it. And floating on the surface was a flower petal. As I watched, it sank. Just before it reached the bottom, it transformed into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic. Wondrous to behold. The flower petal had come from a lily. Your mother. The day I came downstairs, the day the bowl was empty, was the day your mother... I'll likely be getting the sack any day now. I just couldn't leave without telling someone about him. Grawpy! Down here, you great buffoon! Oh. Grawpy! I brought you some company. I couldn't just leave him because— Because he's my brother. Blimey. Well, half-brother, really. He's completely harmless, just like I said. A little high-spirited is all. Ahh! Grawpy, that is not polite! Hagrid, do something! We've talked about this. You do not grab, do you? That's your new friend, Hermione. Grawpy! Grawp! Put me down! Now! You all right? Fine. Just needs a firm hand, is all. I think you've got an admirer. You just stay away from her, all right? He gets his own food and all. It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone. You will look after him, won't you? I'm the only family he's got. Ah, Hagrid! Usual, I presume? No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies. Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter. Welcome back, Mr Potter. Welcome back. Doris Crockford, Mr Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last. Harry P— P— Potter. C— Can't tell you how p— pleased I am to meet you. Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defence against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts Oh, nice to meet you. F— Fearfully f— fascinating subject. N—Not that you n—need it, eh, P—Potter? Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Goodbye. I wanted you to have this. Original Order of the Phoenix. Marlene McKinnon. She was killed two weeks after this was taken. Voldemort wiped out her entire family. Frank and Alice Longbottom. Neville's parents. They suffered a fate worse than death if you ask me. It's been 14 years. And still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad. Do you really think there's going to be a war, Sirius? It feels like it did before. You keep it. Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now. Can I ask you something? You want to know why I stopped you facing that Boggart, yes? I would've thought it would be obvious. I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort. I did think of Voldemort at first. But then I remembered that night on the train and the Dementor. Well, I'm very impressed. That suggests that what you fear the most is fear itself. This is very wise. Before I fainted, I heard something. A woman, screaming. Well, Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. Our pain becomes their power. I think it was my mother, the night she was murdered. You know, the very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognised you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother, Lily's. Yes. Oh, yes, I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch, she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others, even, and perhaps most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. And your father, James, on the other hand, he, uh... He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. A talent, rumour has it, he passed on to you. You're more like them than you know, Harry. In time, you'll come to see just how much. [Whispering] "Famous Fire Eaters." "15th Century Fiends." Flamel. Nicolas Flamel. Where are you? [Screaming] [Filch] Who's there? I know you're in there. You can't hide. Who is it? Show yourself. [Professor Quirrell] Severus, I— I— You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell. [Quirrell] Wh— What do you mean? [Snape] You know perfectly well what I mean. We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie. Oh, professors. I found this. In the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed. Room 11. Hedwig! Right smart bird you got there, Mr Potter. She arrived here just five minutes before yourself. [Cornelius Fudge clearing his throat] As the Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr Potter, that earlier this evening, your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, stuck in a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. So, that's that. And no harm done. Pea soup? Uh, no, thank you. Um, Minister? Yes. I don't understand. Understand? I broke the law. Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home. Oh, come now, Harry. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunt. On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things, was very, very irresponsible. The state of things, sir? We have a killer on the loose. Sirius Black, you mean? But what's he got to do with me? Oh... Nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters. And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts. Oh, these are your new school books. I took the liberty of having them brought here for you. Now, Tom will show you to your room. Hedwig. Oh, by the way Harry, whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't, uh... wander. "Regulus Arcturus Black." R.A.B. "I know I will be dead long before you read this. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it." R.A.B. is Sirius's brother? Yes. The question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux? Ah! Oi! You been spying on us, have you? Kreacher has been watching. Maybe he knows where the real locket is? You ever seen this before? Kreacher! It's Master Regulus's locket. But there were two, weren't there? Where's the other one? Kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is. Yes, but did you ever see it? Was it in this house? Filthy Mudblood, Death Eater's are coming— Blood traitor, Weasley. Answer her. Yes. It was here. In this house. A most evil object. How do you mean? Before Master Regulus died, he ordered Kreacher to destroy it. But no matter how hard Kreacher tried, he could not do it. Well, where is it now? Did someone take it? He came in the night. He took many things, including the locket. Who did? Who was it, Kreacher? Mundungus. Mundungus Fletcher. Find him. What a charismatic quartet. Hello. I'm Rita Skeeter. I write for the Daily Prophet, but of course you know that, don't you? It's you we don't know. You're the juicy news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? What mysteries do the muscles mask? Does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick? Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Hm? Shall we start with the youngest? Lovely. This is cosy. Uh, it's a broom cupboard. You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you? Oh, um, no. So, tell me, Harry. Here you sit, a mere boy of 12— Um, 14, so... About to compete against three students, not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself, but who have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned? Um, I— I don't know. I haven't really thought about it. Just ignore the quill. Of course, you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you? 14. Your story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament? Uh, no. I— I didn't enter. Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel, Harry. Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how'd you think they'd feel? Proud? Or concerned that you attitude shows, at best, a pathological need for attention. Worst, a psychotic death wish? Hey, my eyes aren't "glistening with the ghosts of my past." Here you go, love. Sightseeing tour? Leaves in 15 minutes. Where are we? Shaftesbury Avenue. I used to come to the theatre here with Mum and Dad. Dunno why I thought of it, just popped into my head. This way. We need to change. How the ruddy... Undetectable Extension Charm. You're amazing, you are. Always the tone of surprise. Ah, that'll be the books. What about all the people at the wedding? Do you think we should go back? They're after you, mate. We'd put everyone in danger by going back. Ron's right. Coffee? A cappucino, please. You? What she said. Same. So, where do we go from here? Leaky Cauldron? It's too dangerous. If Voldemort really has taken over the Ministry, then none of the old places are safe. Everyone from the wedding, they will have gone underground, into hiding. My rucksack with all my things, I've left it at The Burrow. You're joking. I've had all the essentials packed for days. Just in case. [Ron] By the way, these jeans, not my favourite. Down! Stupefy! Expulso! Petrificus Totalis! Go. Leave! Lock the door. Get the lights.
